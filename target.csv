"JimT", "The Holy Stone JY03 is a cool, smart looking first person view (FPV) drone that's loaded with features including two 1080p cameras, all for under $90. The drone is delivered in a convenient carrying case that includes a remote transmitter, 2 batteries which provide extended flight time, propeller guards, charging cable, instructions and 4 extra propellers. Functional features include cool, bright blue LED lighting, speed control, one-touch take-off and landing, a 360 degree stunt maneuver and image capture by gesture. This versatile drone can be flown two ways â€“ by using the transmitter remote or through a wireless phone connection using the phone app which includes full controls on your smart phone screen. Either way, the drone flies ...", "5 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase JimT", "  "
"Jonathan", "The camera is definitely not even close to 1080p , and will not stay recording it cuts in and out of actually recording. Also the drone flys around on its own even when having adjusted the trim and it is not windy outside. Bought for my sons first drone and would not recommend, the directions are extremely vague and the buttons do not do what they say and my iPhone 13 cannot stay connected to the drone consistently either.", "1 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase Jonathan Incentivized Review", "  "
"Eric", "Pros: - Under 250g so no need to register with the FAA to fly in the US - Durable and has taken a few good crashes while I've pushed it to test it out - Able to control with a smartphone app that allows you to control it fully, adjust trim, switch between two cameras and save photos - Affordable - Great starter drone to get into the hobby and learn how they work or just have fun with knowing it's not a huge monetary loss if it is crashed and damaged Cons: - Instructions for setting up the drone and the smartphone app are a little confusing, you need to be able to intuitively figure out some of the set up for at least the app, if not also just assembly (was difficult to get the optional blade guards installed) - Blade guards are flexible en...", "4 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase Eric Incentivized Review", "11/15/2023  "
"Bassim", "It was my sons birthday he wanted this and he pretty likes it it is a sturdy drone but the camera is kinda hard at least for us and i still don't know how to set it up", "4 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase Bassim", "2/4/2024  "
"Qing", "I purchased this drone for my son, It's been a fantastic introduction to the world of drones. The setup was a breeze, and the included instructions were clear and easy to follow. My son had it up and running in no time. This drone has endured a few crashes without any damage. The propeller guards are a great feature for beginners. The camera on this little drone is surprisingly good. It's not professional-grade, but for a kid's drone, it's more than enough to capture fun moments.", "5 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase Qing Incentivized Review", "11/2/2023  "
"", "For those wanting to learn the basics of droning I would highly recommend the JY03 from Holy Stone. If you have a kid or adult wanting to learn the basics then this drone is for you. It Hs many if the features of higher end drone such as a carrying case, two batteries, WiFi , and a 1080p camera. All for the price point below $60. There is one thing to consider when looking at drones in this price range is the lack of GPS. The GPS function gives the drone stability especially in windy situations. This requires the pilot to have to exercise more control then a simular drone with GPS. My recommendation is when you first fly the drone to pick a wide open area . Non GPS drones requires some fine tuning with the trim to get them to fly steady. ...", "5 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase ", "9/16/2023  "
"Nok", "JY03 Drone responds well to commands. It is a good beginner that could be used for learning/training. Bigger than I expected, but it is light and sturdy. It flies and holds well even in windy situations. The camera takes good pictures. A nice addition to my collection of Holy Stone drones.", "5 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase Nok", "8/17/2023  "
"Arlene", "My son saved his money for months to buy this drone. It works fine when there is no wind. However when we went to download the app to connect with the camera, the website appeared sketchy. We received a warning that the security certificate was outdated. We didn't want to take out chances downloading the app, so our son can't use the camera. :( The drone is clearly cheaply made, which we expected for the price.", "2 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase Arlene", "9/14/2023  "
"Thomas", "well, never could connect the camera to the phone. Flew ok for about 5 times and now it's having problems flying forward. it's not hovering like it did before. purchased a 2 year plan with it. Walmart will not help with the return. They said to contact the seller. Now I looked it up and Walmart is supposed to take Care of the return. Very disappointed", "1 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase Thomas", "9/10/2023  "
"Mark", "The camera had the quality of a recycled 2 megapixal flip phone camera. The controls were unresponsive %26 would not calibrate correctly.", "1 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase Mark", "2/18/2024  "
